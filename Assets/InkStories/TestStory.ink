Hello, little one I am glad to see you are alive.  #speaker:Moose #portrait:Moose #layout:Right #speed:30
Are you alright otherwise?
The storm seems to have washed you downstream, it is a wonder you are alive.#speaker:Moose #portrait:Moose #layout:Right #speed:30
Hi, no I seem fine. . . just wet and tired. Where am I?  #speaker:Sylvester #portrait:Sylvester #layout:Left #speed:30
A tiny isle in the stream I enjoy visiting. Sadly it seems to have been hit by the storm too. The lightning caused a fire. :(    #speaker:Moose #portrait:Moose #layout:Right #speed:30
I am sorry to hear that and I wish I could help. But I need to get back home. #speaker:Sylvester #portrait:Sylvester #layout:Left #speed:30
I believe we can help one another. You help me to replant some of the lost plants and I will give you a ride across the water. #speaker:Moose #portrait:Moose #layout:Right #speed:30
